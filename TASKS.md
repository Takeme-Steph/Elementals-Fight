# TASKS.md — Elementals-Fight work queue

Maintained by Claude AI (Cowork). **Claude Code:** read top-to-bottom, pick up the first task not marked done, create a feature branch, implement it, commit, then mark the entry `[x]` with a one-line summary of what changed before moving to the next. If a task lacks enough context to act on safely, stop and flag it rather than guessing at design intent.

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done

## Format for new tasks
Each task gets: a scope-limited title, the *why* (architectural reasoning, not just the ask), acceptance criteria, and any files known to be relevant. Claude AI keeps entries in this shape going forward.

## Queue

### [x] Block input bypasses match-active gating
**Why:** `PlayerController.Jump()` and `Attack()` are both polled inside `Update()`, which already guards on `!sceneHandler.isGameOver && sceneHandler.activeMatch` before doing anything. `Block` is different - `HandleBlock(bool isHeld)` is wired directly to `InputReader.BlockEvent` and fires immediately on press/release, so it never passes through that same gate. Result: holding Block still works during the post-round countdown (`activeMatch == false`) and after Game Over (`isGameOver == true`), even though every other action is correctly locked out in both cases. `PlayerAutoPilot` doesn't have this bug - its `Update()` already gates *before* calling `RequestBlock`, so this is human-input-only.

**Acceptance criteria:** `HandleBlock` in `PlayerController` checks the same condition (`sceneHandler == null || sceneHandler.isGameOver || !sceneHandler.activeMatch`) before calling `stateMachine.RequestBlock(isHeld)`, mirroring how `Jump()`/`Attack()` already guard. Pressing/holding Block during the round-transition countdown or after Game Over should do nothing. Normal blocking during active gameplay must still work exactly as before.

**Relevant files:** `Assets/Scripts/PlayerCTRLs/PlayerController.cs`

**Done:** Added the same `sceneHandler == null || sceneHandler.isGameOver || !sceneHandler.activeMatch` guard to the top of `HandleBlock`, mirroring `Jump()`/`Attack()`.
